# Debug

In this section, you will learn how to debug the compilation process easily as well as how to get help in case you cannot resolve your issue.

## Debug Artifacts

**Concrete-Numpy** has an artifact system to simplify the process of debugging issues.

### Automatic export.

In case of compilation failures, artifacts are exported automatically to the `.artifacts` directory under the working directory. Let's intentionally create a compilation failure to show what kinds of things are exported.

```python
def f(x):
    return np.sin(x)
```

This function fails to compile because **Concrete-Numpy** does not support floating-point outputs. When you try to compile it, an exception will be raised and the artifacts will be exported automatically. If you go the `.artifacts` directory under the working directory, you'll see the following files:

#### environment.txt

This file contains information about your setup (i.e., your operating system and python version).

```

return %1
```

```
%0 = x              # EncryptedScalar<uint3>
%1 = sin(%0)        # EncryptedScalar<float64>
return %1
```

return %1
```

### Manual export.

Manual exports are mostly used for visualization. Nonetheless, they can be very useful for demonstrations. Here is how to perform one:

```python
import concrete.numpy as cnp
import numpy as np

artifacts = cnp.DebugArtifacts("/tmp/custom/export/path")

@cnp.compiler({"x": "encrypted"})
def f(x):
    return 127 - (50 * (np.sin(x) + 1)).astype(np.int64)

inputset = range(2 ** 3)
circuit = f.compile(inputset, artifacts=artifacts)

artifacts.export()
```

If you go to the `/tmp/custom/export/path` directory, you'll see the following files:

#### 1.initial.graph.txt

%2 = 1                             # ClearScalar<uint1>
%3 = x                             # EncryptedScalar<uint1>
%4 = sin(%3)                       # EncryptedScalar<float64>
%5 = add(%4, %2)                   # EncryptedScalar<float64>
%6 = multiply(%1, %5)              # EncryptedScalar<float64>
%7 = astype(%6, dtype=int_)        # EncryptedScalar<uint1>
