# Installation

**Concrete-Numpy** is natively supported on Linux and macOS for Python 3.8 and 3.9, but if you have Docker support in your platform, you can use the docker image to use **Concrete-Numpy**.

## Using PyPI

You can install **Concrete-Numpy** from PyPI:

```shell
pip install -U pip wheel setuptools
pip install concrete-numpy
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Apple silicon users must use docker installation (explained below) as there is no ARM version of some of our dependencies for the time being.
{% endhint %}

## Using Docker

You can also get the **Concrete-Numpy** docker image:

```shell
docker pull zamafhe/concrete-numpy:v0.11.0
```

### Starting a Jupyter server.

By default, the entry point of the **Concrete-Numpy** docker image is a jupyter server that you can access from your browser:

```shell
docker run --rm -it -p 8888:8888 zamafhe/concrete-numpy:v0.11.0
```

To save notebooks on host, you can use a local volume:

```shell
docker run --rm -it -p 8888:8888 -v /path/to/notebooks:/data zamafhe/concrete-numpy:v0.11.0
```

### Starting a Bash session.
